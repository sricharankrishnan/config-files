# Vim Editor Installation and Configuration
<br/>

- You will first need to install vim into your local system. Use the following commands taken from [Ubuntu Linux Install vim Text Editor using apt-get](https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/howto-install-vim-on-ubuntu-linux/) to start:
```console
foo@bar_your_terimal_screen:~$ sudo apt update
foo@bar_your_terimal_screen:~$ sudo apt install vim
foo@bar_your_terimal_screen:~$ vim --version
```


- Then you will need to create a configuration file that will help you work with your code files. In your Home Directory, create a file name ```.vimrc```. Then copy and paste the configuraton details from the [vimrc.txt file in this repository](https://github.com/sricharankrishnan/config-files/blob/master/vim/vimrc.txt) into your local file. Use the command ```:wq``` to Save and Exit. You should now be ready to use Vim in your local system.
